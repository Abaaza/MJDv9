# Current Status - Match Results Not Saving

## What's Happening
- ✅ Excel upload works
- ✅ Matching works (10/10 items matched successfully)
- ❌ **ZERO results are being saved to the database**
- ❌ View shows "No results found" (because database has 0 results)
- ❌ Excel export is blank (because database has 0 results)

## Root Cause
Every attempt to save a match result fails with:
```
ArgumentValidationError: Object contains extra field `isManuallyEdited` that is not in the validator.
```

## What I've Fixed
1. Added `isManuallyEdited` to the mutation args validator
2. Made `isManuallyEdited` optional in the schema
3. Added proper handling in the mutation
4. Re-added the field to backend code

## What Needs to Happen
You have `npx convex dev` running in your terminal. It needs to reload to pick up the changes. Watch for:
```
✔ Convex functions ready! (X.XXs)
```

Once you see that message, the saves will work.

## To Test After Reload
1. Upload a new Excel file
2. You should see results in View Matches
3. Export should contain all matched items

## If Convex Doesn't Auto-Reload
Try pressing Ctrl+C in the Convex terminal and run:
```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will force it to reload with the latest changes.
