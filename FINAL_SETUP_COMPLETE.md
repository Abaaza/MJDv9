# ✅ HTTPS Setup Complete!

## 🎉 Your Backend is Now HTTPS-Enabled!

### What's Done:
1. ✅ SSL certificate created (self-signed)
2. ✅ Nginx configured for HTTPS
3. ✅ Port 443 is open in Security Group
4. ✅ Backend CORS updated to allow Amplify

## 🚨 FINAL STEP: Update Amplify

### 1. Go to AWS Amplify Console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/

### 2. Click on your app: `main`

### 3. Go to "Environment variables"

### 4. Update or Add:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://13.218.146.247/api
```
(Change from http:// to https://)

### 5. Click "Save"
Amplify will automatically redeploy (takes ~2 minutes)

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### Certificate Warning
When you first access the API, you'll see a certificate warning:
- This is NORMAL for self-signed certificates
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to 13.218.146.247"
- Your browser will remember this

### Test Your API:
1. Direct API: https://13.218.146.247/api/health
2. Your App: https://main.d3j084kic0l1ff.amplifyapp.com

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

If login still doesn't work:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Check browser console** for errors
3. **Visit the API directly** first to accept certificate:
   https://13.218.146.247/api/health

## 📊 Current Setup:
```
Amplify (HTTPS) → Your API (HTTPS) → Backend (HTTP localhost)
     ✅                 ✅                    ✅
```

## 🚀 For Production:

Consider these improvements:
1. **Use CloudFront** (automatic valid SSL)
2. **Get a domain name** (e.g., api.yourcompany.com)
3. **Use Let's Encrypt** for free valid SSL certificate

## Quick CloudFront Alternative:

If the self-signed certificate causes too many issues:
1. Create CloudFront distribution
2. Point to 13.218.146.247 (HTTP)
3. Use CloudFront URL in Amplify (automatic HTTPS)

Your BOQ Matching System is now ready for secure communication between Amplify and your backend!
