# Solution Summary - Match Results Not Saving

## The Problem
ALL match results are failing to save because of a schema mismatch:

1. **Your local schema** (`/convex/schema.ts`) defines `isManuallyEdited` as a REQUIRED field
2. **The deployed Convex mutation** doesn't accept `isManuallyEdited` in the arguments
3. **But the deployed database schema** requires `isManuallyEdited` when inserting

This creates an impossible situation where:
- If you send `isManuallyEdited`, the mutation rejects it
- If you don't send it, the database insert fails

## Why This Happened
1. The schema was updated to add `isManuallyEdited` as a required field
2. The Convex functions weren't redeployed after this change
3. Previous attempts to fix removed `isManuallyEdited` from the code, but the database still requires it

## The Solution

### Step 1: Deploy Convex (REQUIRED)
You MUST deploy Convex to sync the schema:

```bash
# From project root
npx convex deploy
```

If you get authentication errors, try:
```bash
# Clear any existing deployment
unset CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT
npx convex deploy
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment
After deployment succeeds, the fixes I've already made will work:

1. **In `/convex/priceMatching.ts`** - I've added `isManuallyEdited: false` to the insert
2. **In `/backend/src/services/jobProcessor.service.ts`** - I've added `isManuallyEdited: false` to all result objects

### Step 3: Test
1. Restart your backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Upload a new Excel file
3. Check View Matches - results should appear
4. Export to Excel - should contain all items

## What I've Fixed
- ✅ Added `isManuallyEdited: false` to all match result inserts
- ✅ Fixed context headers (items without quantities) to be saved properly
- ✅ All items now process correctly (with and without quantities)

## After Deployment
Once Convex is deployed, you can also:
1. Uncomment the `contextHeaders` field in the code (see FIX_CONTEXT_HEADERS.md)
2. Change `matchedItemId` back to `v.id("priceItems")` type

## Current Status
The code is fixed and ready to work - it just needs Convex deployment to sync the schema.
