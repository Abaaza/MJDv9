# IMMEDIATE FIX - Match Results Not Saving

## Root Cause
The deployed Convex functions are out of sync with your local schema. The deployed version:
- Does NOT accept `isManuallyEdited` in the mutation arguments
- But REQUIRES `isManuallyEdited` when inserting into the database

## Quick Fix (Works Immediately)

### Option 1: Deploy Convex (Recommended)
```bash
# From project root
npx convex deploy
```

This will sync your local schema with the deployed functions and fix all validation issues.

### Option 2: Temporary Workaround (If Deployment Fails)

If you can't deploy right now, here's a workaround that should work with the current deployed version:

1. Edit `/backend/src/services/jobProcessor.service.ts`:

Find these sections and add `isManuallyEdited: false`:

**Line ~369:**
```typescript
const contextResult = {
  jobId: job.jobId as any,
  rowNumber: item.rowNumber,
  originalDescription: item.description,
  originalQuantity: 0,
  originalUnit: item.unit || '',
  originalRowData: item.originalRowData || {},
  matchedItemId: undefined,
  matchedDescription: '',
  matchedCode: '',
  matchedUnit: '',
  matchedRate: 0,
  confidence: 0,
  isManuallyEdited: false,  // ADD THIS LINE
  matchMethod: 'CONTEXT',
  totalPrice: 0,
  notes: 'Context header (no quantity)',
};
```

**Line ~422:**
```typescript
const resultToSave = {
  jobId: job.jobId as any,
  rowNumber: item.rowNumber,
  originalDescription: item.description,
  originalQuantity: item.quantity || 0,
  originalUnit: item.unit || '',
  originalRowData: item.originalRowData || {},
  matchedItemId: matchResult.matchedItemId || undefined,
  matchedDescription: matchResult.matchedDescription || '',
  matchedCode: matchResult.matchedCode || '',
  matchedUnit: matchResult.matchedUnit || '',
  matchedRate: matchResult.matchedRate || 0,
  confidence: matchResult.confidence || 0,
  isManuallyEdited: false,  // ADD THIS LINE
  matchMethod: job.method,
  totalPrice: (item.quantity || 0) * (matchResult.matchedRate || 0),
  notes: '',
};
```

**Line ~451:**
```typescript
const failedResult = {
  jobId: job.jobId as any,
  rowNumber: item.rowNumber,
  originalDescription: item.description,
  originalQuantity: item.quantity || 0,
  originalUnit: item.unit || '',
  originalRowData: item.originalRowData || {},
  matchedItemId: undefined,
  matchedDescription: '',
  matchedCode: '',
  matchedUnit: '',
  matchedRate: 0,
  confidence: 0,
  isManuallyEdited: false,  // ADD THIS LINE
  matchMethod: job.method,
  totalPrice: 0,
  notes: `Error: ${error.message}`,
};
```

2. Restart the backend:
```bash
# Kill the current backend process (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
cd backend && npm run dev
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Upload a new Excel file
2. Check the backend logs - you should NOT see validation errors
3. Check "View Matches" - results should appear
4. Export to Excel - should contain all matched items

## What Changed Since It Last Worked

The issue appears to be that:
1. The local schema was updated to include `isManuallyEdited` as a required field
2. The Convex functions weren't redeployed after this change
3. The mutation code was modified to remove `isManuallyEdited` thinking it wasn't in the schema
4. But the database schema still requires it, causing ALL saves to fail

## Long-term Solution

1. Always run `npx convex deploy` after schema changes
2. Consider using `npx convex dev` during development for auto-sync
3. Add the `contextHeaders` field back once Convex is deployed
