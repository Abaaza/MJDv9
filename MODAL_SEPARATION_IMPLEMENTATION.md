# Modal Separation Implementation - 2025-07-05

## Overview
Separated the match results display into two distinct modals to resolve conflicts between AI methods (COHERE/OPENAI) and LOCAL method implementations.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Components Created

#### AIMatchResultsModal.tsx
- Handles COHERE and OPENAI match results
- Features:
  - Separate state management for AI, LOCAL, and MANUAL matches
  - Radio button selection between AI Match, Local Match, and Manual Search
  - Automatic local test execution when switching to LOCAL
  - Proper state preservation when switching between match types
  - Color-coded display (Blue for AI, Green for LOCAL, Purple for MANUAL)

#### LocalMatchResultsModal.tsx
- Handles LOCAL method match results
- Features:
  - Simplified state management for LOCAL and MANUAL matches only
  - Radio button selection between Local Match and Manual Search
  - Stores original LOCAL matches to allow reverting from MANUAL
  - Color-coded display (Green for LOCAL, Purple for MANUAL)

### 2. Updated Pages

#### PriceMatching.tsx
- Added modal display instead of navigation to Projects page
- Added state tracking for completed job method
- Shows appropriate modal based on matching method
- Modal appears in fullscreen overlay when "View Results" is clicked

#### Projects.tsx
- Simplified to show only summary statistics
- Removed inline table display
- Added "View Detailed Results" button that opens appropriate modal
- Shows:
  - Total items count
  - Matched items count
  - Total quotation value
  - Export and discount/markup buttons

### 3. Key Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - AI methods have their own logic for handling 3-way switching
   - LOCAL method has simplified 2-way switching
   - No more conflicts between different matching method behaviors

2. **Better State Management**
   - Each modal manages its own state independently
   - Prevents state corruption when switching between match types
   - Proper preservation of original matches

3. **Improved User Experience**
   - Clear visual separation between different job types
   - Consistent behavior within each modal type
   - No unexpected jumps between match types

### 4. Usage Flow

#### For AI Jobs (COHERE/OPENAI):
1. User completes matching job
2. Clicks "View Results" → AIMatchResultsModal opens
3. Can switch between:
   - AI Match (original AI result)
   - Local Match (runs test on demand, auto-applies)
   - Manual Search (opens search modal)

#### For LOCAL Jobs:
1. User completes matching job
2. Clicks "View Results" → LocalMatchResultsModal opens
3. Can switch between:
   - Local Match (original LOCAL result)
   - Manual Search (opens search modal)

### 5. Technical Implementation Details

- Both modals use the same API endpoints
- Match type switching is handled internally within each modal
- Results are fetched once and managed locally
- Updates are sent to backend via PATCH requests
- Manual match modal is shared between both implementations

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test AI job with all three match type switches
2. Test LOCAL job with both match type switches
3. Verify state persistence when closing/reopening modals
4. Test export functionality from both modal types
5. Verify manual search works correctly in both contexts
