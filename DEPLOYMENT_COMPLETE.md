## 📡 Working API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required):
```
GET  http://13.218.146.247/api/health
POST http://13.218.146.247/api/auth/register
POST http://13.218.146.247/api/auth/login
```

### Protected Endpoints (Require Auth Token):
```
GET  http://13.218.146.247/api/price-matching/jobs
POST http://13.218.146.247/api/price-matching/upload-and-match
GET  http://13.218.146.247/api/price-matching/:jobId/status
GET  http://13.218.146.247/api/price-matching/:jobId/results
GET  http://13.218.146.247/api/price-list
```

## 🚀 How to Use Your API

### 1. Register a New User:
```bash
curl -X POST http://13.218.146.247/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password123","name":"Test User"}'
```

### 2. Login to Get Token:
```bash
curl -X POST http://13.218.146.247/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

### 3. Use Token for Protected Endpoints:
```bash
curl -X GET http://13.218.146.247/api/price-matching/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## 🔧 Current Issues & Solutions

### Frontend 500 Error
The root URL (http://13.218.146.247/) returns 500 because there's no frontend built. This is NORMAL for an API-only deployment.

**Solutions:**
1. Use the API endpoints directly
2. Build a frontend separately
3. Use Postman or curl to test the API

### Why No Frontend?
Your deployment only included the backend API. The frontend would need to be:
1. Built locally first (`cd frontend && npm run build`)
2. Uploaded to the server
3. Served by nginx

## 💰 Costs
- **EC2 t3.micro**: ~$8/month
- **Data Transfer**: First 100GB free
- **Public IP**: Free while instance is running

## 🔒 Security Recommendations

For production use:
1. **Add HTTPS**: Use AWS Certificate Manager + Application Load Balancer
2. **Domain Name**: Register a domain (e.g., boq-api.yourdomain.com)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
4. **API Keys**: Add API key authentication
5. **Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch for alerts

## 📊 Testing Your Deployment

The system can now handle:
- ✅ Large Excel files (2000+ rows)
- ✅ Multiple concurrent users
- ✅ Long-running matching operations
- ✅ File uploads up to 50MB

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Check Server Status:
```bash
ssh -i boq-key-202507161911.pem ec2-user@13.218.146.247
pm2 status
pm2 logs
```

### Restart Application:
```bash
pm2 restart all
```

### Check Nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo nginx -t
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test the API with your BOQ Excel files
2. Build and deploy the frontend (optional)
3. Set up a domain name
4. Add HTTPS certificate
5. Implement additional security measures

Your BOQ Matching System API is ready for use! 🚀
