# Fix Summary

## 1. CSV File Upload Support
**Status**: Fixed ✅

**What was fixed**:
- Updated `/backend/src/middleware/upload.ts` to allow CSV files in addition to Excel files
- Added CSV MIME types ('text/csv', 'application/csv') to allowed file types
- Updated `/backend/handler.js` to include CSV file types in the binary content list for Lambda

**Files modified**:
- `/backend/src/middleware/upload.ts` - Added CSV support in uploadExcel middleware
- `/backend/handler.js` - Added CSV types to serverless-http binary configuration

## 2. Stop Job Functionality
**Status**: Already Fixed ✅

**Previous fixes (from STOP_JOBS_FIX.md)**:
- Added missing return statement in `cancelJob` method
- Enhanced logging throughout stop job flow
- Added job status checks to prevent cancelling completed jobs
- Improved error handling with detailed messages

**Current status**:
- Stop job button works correctly
- Stop all jobs button is already present in Projects page
- Button appears when there are running jobs
- Responsive text: "Stop All Jobs" on desktop, "Stop All" on mobile

## 3. Lambda 500 Error on File Upload
**Status**: Partially Fixed ⚠️

**What was fixed**:
- Added CSV and multipart/form-data to binary types in handler.js

**Remaining issue**:
- The Lambda deployment still returns 500 errors for file uploads
- This appears to be a deployment-specific issue that requires:
  1. Redeploying the Lambda function with the updated handler.js
  2. Ensuring API Gateway is configured to handle binary media types
  3. Verifying the serverless.yml configuration includes proper binary media type settings

## Recommendations

1. **For immediate testing**: Use a local backend server instead of the Lambda endpoint
2. **For Lambda deployment**: 
   - Run `npm run build:all` and `serverless deploy` to update the Lambda function
   - Verify API Gateway binary media types include: 
     - multipart/form-data
     - text/csv
     - application/csv
   - Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages

## Test Script Usage

To test the fixes locally:
```bash
# Start local backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run tests
node test-csv-upload.js  # Tests CSV upload locally
```

To test on Lambda (after redeployment):
```powershell
./test-stop-jobs.ps1  # Tests file upload and stop functionality
```
