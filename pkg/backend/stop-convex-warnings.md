# How to Stop Convex Log Warnings

The warnings you're seeing are because Convex is still trying to fetch logs from its database, but we've moved log storage to the backend's in-memory system.

## Steps to resolve:

1. **Stop and restart Convex dev server**:
   ```bash
   # In frontend directory
   # Stop convex dev (Ctrl+C if running)
   # Then restart it
   npx convex dev
   ```

2. **Clear any stuck jobs in Convex dashboard**:
   - Go to your Convex dashboard
   - Check the "Functions" tab for any running scheduled functions
   - Look for any jobs with status "processing" or "matching" and manually update them to "completed" or "failed"

3. **Comment out log-related Convex functions** (optional):
   If warnings persist, you can temporarily disable the Convex log functions:
   
   In `frontend/convex/jobLogs.ts`, comment out the query:
   ```typescript
   // export const getJobLogs = query({
   //   args: {
   //     jobId: v.string(),
   //   },
   //   handler: async (ctx, args) => {
   //     return await ctx.db
   //       .query("jobLogs")
   //       .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("jobId"), args.jobId))
   //       .order("desc")
   //       .take(100);
   //   },
   // });
   ```

4. **Check for any scheduled functions**:
   Look in your Convex dashboard under "Scheduled Functions" and cancel any that are repeatedly failing.

## Why this happens:

- We moved from Convex-based log storage to in-memory log storage in the backend
- Old jobs or scheduled functions might still be trying to query Convex for logs
- Convex retries failed queries with exponential backoff (hence the increasing wait times)

## Current Architecture:

- **Job Status**: Still stored in Convex (works fine)
- **Job Logs**: Now stored in backend memory (via `logStorage.service.ts`)
- **Log Endpoint**: `/api/jobs/:jobId/logs` serves logs from memory

The warnings should stop once all old jobs complete or timeout.
