# Fixes Applied - 2025-07-05

## Issues Reported by User

1. **OpenAI match jumping to manual instead of local when clicking Local radio button**
2. **Manual match not reverting display when switching back to local** - The match item display box changed back to green (correct) but still showed the manually matched item instead of the local match

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Issue 1**: The local test mutation wasn't properly handling the case where no local matches were found, causing the UI state to become inconsistent
2. **Issue 2**: The matched item display was always showing `result.matchedDescription` from the database instead of checking which match type was selected and displaying the appropriate stored match

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Match Display Logic (Projects.tsx)
- Modified the matched item display to dynamically show the correct match based on the selected match type
- Added logic to check `selectedMatchTypes[result._id]` and display:
  - `aiMatchResults[result._id]` when AI is selected
  - `localMatchResults[result._id]` when LOCAL is selected  
  - `manualMatchResults[result._id]` when MANUAL is selected
  - Falls back to `result.matchedDescription` if no stored match exists

### 2. Enhanced Local Test Mutation Error Handling (Projects.tsx)
- Added proper error handling when no local matches are found
- Reverts to previous match type if local test fails or returns no matches
- Ensures match type is properly set to LOCAL before applying the match
- Shows appropriate error message "No local matches found" when test returns empty

### 3. Verified API Endpoints
- Confirmed `/api/price-matching/test/local` endpoint exists and is functional
- Confirmed `testLocalMatch` controller function is implemented correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **For OpenAI/COHERE Jobs**:
   - Clicking Local radio button will run a local test
   - If matches found: Auto-applies and shows local match with green background
   - If no matches found: Shows error toast and reverts to AI match
   - No more jumping to manual match unexpectedly

2. **For Match Display**:
   - When switching from Manual → Local: Display shows the actual local match (not the manual match)
   - When switching from Manual → AI: Display shows the actual AI match
   - Color coding remains correct (green for local, blue for AI, purple for manual)
   - Each match type's data is preserved and displayed correctly when selected

## Additional Notes

- Logs are correctly NOT displayed in Projects page (as requested by user)
- The comprehensive test suite has been created and run, showing 40% pass rate
- Production readiness report has been generated
- The switching behavior now follows the documented flow in SWITCHING_BEHAVIOR.md
