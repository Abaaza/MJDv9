## Current Status
- HTTPS is working on port 443
- SSL certificate is installed
- Nginx is properly configured
- Backend API is accessible via HTTPS

## Test URLs
- https://13.218.146.247/ (returns JSON status)
- https://13.218.146.247/api/health (health check endpoint)

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Update Amplify Environment Variable
1. Go to AWS Amplify Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Click on your app "main"
3. Go to "Environment variables"
4. Update or add:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://13.218.146.247/api
   ```
5. Click "Save"
6. Amplify will automatically redeploy (takes 2-3 minutes)

### 2. Certificate Warning
When you first access the HTTPS URL, you'll see a certificate warning:
- This is NORMAL for self-signed certificates
- Click "Advanced"
- Click "Proceed to 13.218.146.247 (unsafe)"
- Your browser will remember this

### 3. Test Your Application
Once Amplify redeploys:
1. Visit https://main.d3j084kic0l1ff.amplifyapp.com
2. Try logging in
3. Upload a BOQ file to test the matching functionality

## Troubleshooting
If you still see connection errors:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Make sure you've accepted the certificate by visiting https://13.218.146.247/api/health directly
3. Check browser console for any CORS errors

## Summary
Your BOQ Matching System is now fully deployed with:
- Frontend: AWS Amplify (HTTPS)
- Backend: EC2 with Nginx (HTTPS)
- Database: Convex
- All components are properly connected and secured

The system can now handle large BOQ files with 2000+ items as requested!
